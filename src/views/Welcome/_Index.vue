                        My higher education includes a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Business Management as well as a certification
                        in web development through the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp. Certified by the American Society of
                        Quality in process improvement, I am highly skilled with process flowcharting (an invaluable
                        tool in application development). In a collaborative environment, I enjoy teaching others and
                        sharing my knowledge for the benefit of the team.
